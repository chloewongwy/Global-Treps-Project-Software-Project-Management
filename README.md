# Global Treps Project – Software Project Management  

This repository contains our **Software Project Management group project** for COMP3235.  
The project is based on the **Global Treps Case Study**, where we act as project managers responsible for planning, cost estimation, scheduling, resource allocation, and risk/quality management.  

📅 **Project Year: April 2024.**  

## 📖 Project Overview  
The Global Treps Project focuses on creating a **non-profit organization and website** to support global entrepreneurship through “shark-tank-like” events.  
Our project work includes:  
- Summarizing and evaluating proposed projects.  
- Developing a **project scope statement**.  
- Creating a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.  
- Preparing **cost estimates and cost baselines**.  
- Scheduling with **Microsoft Project (MPP file)**.
